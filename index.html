            When she was <span id="num-01">___</span>, 
            <span id="name-01">___</span> <span id="name-02">___</span> Abernathy was a smart and ambitious young girl
            who wanted to be both a lawyer and a doctor "because a <span id="noun-01">___</span> can do anything". 
            She was studying for law school at 16, and by 24, she had earned multiple doctorates from <span id="school-01">___</span>. 
            However, by 32, suffering from burnout, she had turned to alcohol, became obsessed with her pet cat, and would randomly take to cutting pieces of her own <span id="body-part-01">___</span>. 
            By the time she was 40, she had assumed her present state as a <span id="adjective-01">___</span>, <span id="adjective-02">___</span> lunatic, and mother of <span id="num-02">___</span> cats.
